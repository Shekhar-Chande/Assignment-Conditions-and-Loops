// Que1:-  What are conditional statements? Explain conditional statements with syntax and examples.

// Ans:- Conditional Statements are very important in javascript or any other programming language. It is necessary because if a developer wants to execute their code based on some criteria/condition then conditional statements are required. For Example:- we are writing a code for voters those who is greater than or ewual to 18 years old is elegible for vote. in this code we are required conditional statements. Conditional statements are:- if else, switch 


//Syntax of If Else:-
 
// if(condition)
// {

// }
// else{

// }


//Syntax of Switch:-

// switch(expression) {
//     case x:
//        code block
//       break;
//     case y:
//       code block
//       break;
//     default:
//        code block
//   }



let A = 17;
if(A>=18)
{
    console.log("A is eligible for vote");
}
else{
    console.log("A is not eligible for vote");
}
